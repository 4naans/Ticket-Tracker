# Employee Ticket Counter

This was the first React project issued to us on the _Nology bootcamp. The purpose was to get us familiar with creating components and implemented javascript using props and the useState hook. The breif given to us was to create a ticket tracker which took emplyee data from a data.js file, and then to implement a counter component on each employee card.
